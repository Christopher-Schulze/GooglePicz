# GooglePicz Documentation

## üìã Overview
GooglePicz is a native Google Photos client being developed in Rust. The application focuses on performance, security, and user experience. The project is structured as a Rust workspace with multiple crates.

## üöß Project Status: Early Development

**Note**: This project is currently in active development. The information in this documentation reflects the current state and is subject to change as development progresses.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Main Application
- **app**: Central entry point that coordinates all modules.

### Modules
- **auth**: Implements OAuth2 flow with secure token management
- **api_client**: Provides interface to Google Photos API
- **ui**: Handles the user interface (Iced Framework)
- **cache**: Manages local media cache (SQLite)
- **sync**: Handles synchronization with Google Photos
- **packaging**: Handles application packaging

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Rust 1.70+
- **UI Framework**: Iced (wgpu backend)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio
- **Database**: SQLite3
- **HTTP Client**: reqwest
- **OAuth2**: oauth2, google-photos1
- **Image Processing**: image-rs

### Dependencies
```toml
[workspace.dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
oauth2 = "4.4"
google-photos1 = "0.1"
rusqlite = "0.29"
dirs = "5.0"
```

## üöÄ Current Implementation Status

### Core Components
- [x] Basic project structure
- [x] Rust workspace setup
- [x] Module separation
- [ ] Complete API integration

- [ ] Album management
- [ ] Settings panel

## üß™ Testing Strategy (Planned)

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Core functionality tests
- [ ] API client tests
- [ ] Cache layer tests

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Authentication flow
- [ ] Photo synchronization
- [ ] UI interactions

## üì¶ Build & Development

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70 or later
- Cargo
- SQLite development files

### Building
```bash
# Build in debug mode
cargo build

# Build for release
cargo build --release
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## üåé Environment Variables

The application and packaging scripts rely on several environment variables:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` ‚Äì OAuth 2.0 credentials required for authentication.
- `MAC_SIGN_ID` ‚Äì Signing identity used on macOS (optional).
- `APPLE_ID` and `APPLE_PASSWORD` ‚Äì Credentials for notarizing macOS builds (optional).
- `WINDOWS_CERT` and `WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD` ‚Äì Path and password for a Windows code signing certificate (optional).
- `MOCK_REFRESH_TOKEN` ‚Äì Used only for automated tests to bypass live authentication.

## üìù Next Steps

### Short-term Goals
1. Complete basic photo viewing functionality
2. Implement album management
3. Add settings and preferences

### Long-term Goals
1. Video playback support
2. Advanced search features
3. Face recognition and tagging
4. Cross-platform packaging
